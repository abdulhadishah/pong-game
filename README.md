# 🕹️ Pong Game

A classic two-player Pong game built using Python Turtle Graphics, featuring a dark retro UI with cool blue tones and smooth ball physics.

## ✨ Technologies

- `Python`
- `Turtle Graphics`
- `Time`

## 🚀 Features

- Two-player paddle controls
- Ball movement with bounce physics
- Collision detection with paddles and walls
- Score tracking for both players
- Clean, retro-inspired dark UI

## 📍 The Process

This project was built as **Day 22 of the 100 Days of Python Code** course and brought together concepts from previous days. The focus was on managing multiple moving objects at once: two paddles controlled by different users and a ball whose behavior changes based on collisions.

The ball reacts differently when it hits walls or paddles, reverses direction accordingly, and resets when a player misses, allowing scores to be tracked accurately. This project helped reinforce object-oriented design, collision detection, and coordinating interactions between independent game elements.
